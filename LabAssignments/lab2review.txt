Correctness:

- The program has a compiling error:
$ javac *.java
AEScipher.java:11: error: class AES_cipher is public, should be declared in a
file named AES_cipher.java
public class AES_cipher {
       ^
1 error



Style:

- Correct indentation

- Poor block comments

- Both files are missing the header. Remember: Each file must have a block
  comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the student's name, the
  assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about what is contained in
  the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- When searching the Sbox or Rcon you are constantly parsing integers. Perhaps
  it would be more efficient to have them as integers already and save
  constantly parsing.

- The aescipher.java file is incorrectly named as: AESCipher.java
